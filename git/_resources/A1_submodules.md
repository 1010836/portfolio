# 1. submodules?

I know that in git repo we can clone just one branch. 
But what I need is that different users can only have access a parts of the total repos (some specific folder). 
Can I create a branch with just some folders?
what is the best way to achieve what I want?

Git itself grants *repository-wide* read/write access, so **you can’t truly hide part of a repo behind a branch or a sparse checkout**.
Branches always contain the *whole* history, and sparse/partial-clone only *skip downloading* files—they don’t prevent a user who already has `clone` rights from fetching everything later. To give colleagues access to just a sub-directory you must either **split the project into multiple repos** or **use a server-side ACL system that understands path rules**. ([security.stackexchange.com][1], [git-scm.com][2], [gitolite.com][3])

---

## 1  Why a “directory-only branch” won’t work

* **Branches are pointers.** Creating a new branch and deleting files there looks fine locally, but Git still stores every blob and commit, so anyone can check out another branch or run `git fetch --all` to retrieve everything. ([stackoverflow.com][4])
* **Sparse checkout & partial clone ≠ security.** These features speed up monorepo work by checking out only selected paths, but the remote still advertises **all** objects; with normal credentials a user can fetch the rest at any time. ([git-scm.com][2], [git-tower.com][5], [security.stackexchange.com][1])

## 2  Host-provided permissions (GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos)

| Platform     | Read scope | Write-protect specific dirs?                                                     | Notes                                               |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub       | Repo       | No (CODEOWNERS can *require* review but can’t hide files) ([docs.github.com][6]) | Fine-grained PAT scopes still repo-wide.            |
| GitLab       | Repo       | No — issue raised since 2015, not implemented. ([forum.gitlab.com][7])           | “Protected branches” help with *writes*, not reads. |
| Azure DevOps | Repo       | No                                                                               | Same limitation as above.                           |

If you *only* need to stop accidental pushes, protected branches or CODEOWNERS may be enough; they don’t satisfy strict confidentiality.

---

## 3  Split the repository

The safest option is **convert each sensitive folder into its own repo**, then combine them with Git tooling:

### 3.1  Create standalone repos with history

* Use **`git filter-repo`** (or the older `filter-branch`) to extract a path, keeping its commit history:

  ```bash
  git clone --no-tags origin bigrepo temp
  cd temp
  git filter-repo --path src/secret/ --path-rename src/secret/:
  ```

  ([docs.github.com][8], [stackoverflow.com][9])
* Push the result to a new remote and delete the temp clone.

### 3.2  Reconnect with the main project

| Technique                                   | Pros                                                                                                             | Cons                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Submodules** (`git submodule add`)        | Clean boundaries; each part keeps its own issues & CI; easy ACL per repo. ([git-scm.com][10], [git-scm.com][11]) | Extra commands (`submodule update`); unfamiliar to newcomers.                |
| **Subtree merge** (`git subtree add/split`) | Users need no special Git knowledge; content lives in the super-repo. ([git-scm.com][12])                        | History rewritten when pushing back; harder to share write access both ways. |

Most teams pick submodules if **strict isolation** is required; subtrees are fine when you mainly want easier checkouts but don’t mind everyone seeing the code.

---

## 4  Server-side ACL engines

If you really want a *single* repo yet need path-based permissions, run your own Git server that supports them:

| Tool                   | Granularity                                                               | Setup cost               | Where to learn                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gitolite**           | Regex rules on paths (`RW master @all =  src/lib/**`)                     | Light; SSH only          | ([gitolite.com][3], [gitolite.com][13])                                      |
| **Gerrit Code Review** | ACLs on branches *and* file paths (e.g., `refs/heads/main:src/public/**`) | Heavier (Java, database) | ([gerrit-review.googlesource.com][14], [gerrit-review.googlesource.com][15]) |

These tools sit in front of the repos and refuse a `git-upload-pack` or `git receive-pack` if the request touches forbidden paths, so users literally cannot download private code.

---

## 5  Recommended path forward

1. **Audit your confidentiality needs.** If reading the private folder must be impossible, GitHub/GitLab repo-level ACLs are insufficient.
2. **Decide between split vs. self-hosted.**

   * *Most teams*: create a new repo per sensitive folder; link via submodules; give external collaborators access only to those repos.
   * *If monorepo benefits outweigh everything*: self-host with Gitolite/Gerrit and write path rules.
3. **Document your workflow:** include clone commands, submodule instructions, and who owns which repo.
4. **Automate CI/CD:** each sub-repo can have its own pipeline; the super-project’s pipeline can trigger downstream builds when submodules update.

---

### Key take-aways

* Git cannot enforce directory-level secrecy inside a normal hosted repo; clones are all-or-nothing.
* Sparse checkout/partial clone help performance, **not** security.
* Practical options are **split into multiple repos** or **run a server with path-aware ACLs**.
* Submodules + smaller repos keep permissions simple and match GitHub/GitLab’s security model; path-based ACLs require self-hosting.

With one of these patterns you can safely give each user exactly the folders—and nothing more—that they need.

# 2. how submodules?

explain me in detail how can I have a main repo that only I admin has access and the multiple sub projects 
that only some users or groups of users can have access and this should be recursive, 
i.e., inside sub project we can have other subprojects that also have restrict access.  
using Submodules ?

A single “super-repo + sub-repos” layout lets you keep **one private root repository that only you can read** while giving each team access only to the sub-projects they need.  Git submodules are the most common way to wire those repos together because a submodule is nothing more than *a reference to another repository*, whose own permissions are enforced by the hosting platform.  Below is a step-by-step cookbook that covers the architecture, permissions on GitHub/GitLab or on self-hosted Gitolite/Gerrit, daily commands, and common pitfalls—including how to nest submodules recursively and how to keep CI/CD working.

---

## 1  Overall architecture

```
root/
├── .gitmodules        # Contains only submodule pointers
├── docs/              # Public docs you want everyone to see
├── core-app/          # Submodule → repo “core-app.git”
│   └── …
└── clients/
    ├── android/       # Submodule → repo “android-client.git”
    └── ios/           # Submodule → repo “ios-client.git”
        └── shaders/   # *Nested* submodule → repo “ios-shaders.git”
```

* **Root repo** (sometimes called a “meta-repo”) contains *no sensitive source*; only pointers (`<path> <commit-SHA>`) to other repos live in `.gitmodules` and commits. Because Git doesn’t copy the contents of a submodule into the super-repo’s history, users who clone the root but lack rights on a submodule cannot fetch its objects—even if they can see the SHA. ([git-scm.com][1], [git-scm.com][2])
* **Every sub-project is a full Git repository** hosted where you can set repo-level ACLs (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, Azure Repos, or your own Gitolite/Gerrit instance).

This hierarchy can be arbitrarily deep; submodules can themselves contain submodules, and Git has first-class support for “recursive” commands. ([stackoverflow.com][3], [stackoverflow.com][4])

## 2  Granting access

### 2.1  GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket Cloud

| What you need                             | How to do it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only you see the root repo                | Put it in its own **private org or personal space** and don’t add anyone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Per-team read/write on sub-projects       | Create a team/group per repo and set the repo’s *Role/Permission* (Read, Triage/Developer, Maintain, Admin). On GitHub: *Settings ▸ Collaborators & Teams* ([docs.github.com][5], [docs.github.com][6]). On GitLab: *Project ▸ Members* with “Developer” or “Reporter” roles ([docs.gitlab.com][7], [forum.gitlab.com][8]). |
| CI/CD token that can fetch all submodules | Add a machine user or **deploy key** with read-only scope to each restricted repo and store its SSH key or PAT in your pipeline secrets. ([docs.github.com][9], [github.com][10])                                                                                                                                           |

> **Important:** GitHub and GitLab do **not** support path-based read restrictions inside a single repo. Repo-level ACLs are the only native option.  That’s why splitting code into separate repos is mandatory for real secrecy. ([docs.github.com][6], [docs.gitlab.com][7])

### 2.2  Self-hosted with path-based ACLs (optional)

If you insist on one physical repo and need path rules, run your own server:

| Engine       | Path rules?                                                                                                   | Notes                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gitolite** | Yes – `RW  master  @qa = src/**` style rules in `gitolite.conf` ([gitolite.com][11], [stackoverflow.com][12]) | Light (Perl + SSH).                                           |
| **Gerrit**   | Yes – ACLs on `refs/heads/main:src/public/**` or whole branches ([gerrit-review.googlesource.com][13])        | Heavy (Java + database), but integrates code-review workflow. |

---

## 3  Setting up the root repo with submodules

```bash
# 1. Create and push the root repo (private to you)
git init root && cd root
echo "# Meta-repo" > README.md
git add README.md && git commit -m "root skeleton"
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-org/meta.git
git push -u origin main
```

```bash
# 2. Add a sub-project that a team can read
git submodule add --branch main \
    git@github.com:mobile-team/android-client.git clients/android
git commit -m "Add Android client as submodule"
git push
```

* The `--branch` flag records that you track `main` of the child repo; omit it if you prefer pinning a specific commit.
* Repeat for each sub-project (iOS, shaders, reporting-service, etc.).
* When you need a **nested** submodule (e.g., `ios/shaders`), you run the same `git submodule add` *inside* the `ios-client` repo. Team members with access to `ios-client` will automatically see the shader repo; outsiders will not. ([stackoverflow.com][4])

---

## 4  Daily workflow for contributors

```bash
# First-time clone (only submodules the user is allowed to see will fetch)
git clone --recursive git@github.com:your-org/meta.git
# or, if they want to skip private children they can't access:
git clone git@github.com:your-org/meta.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* If a developer does **not** have rights to `clients/ios`, the submodule fetch will fail for that path while the rest of the repo remains usable.  The missing directory is simply an empty checkout. ([github.com][10])
* To pull new commits across the tree:

  ```bash
  git pull --recurse-submodules
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

---

## 5  Keeping CI/CD happy

1. **Give the automation token access to every repo** it must clone. Most CI services let you add PATs or SSH keys to *Secrets / Variables*.
2. In your pipeline, fetch with:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
   ```

   Using `depth` keeps the checkout fast while still respecting each repo’s permissions.
3. When the super-repo records a *new commit* in a submodule, call:

   ```bash
   git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand
   ```

   so the child repo is pushed first; otherwise teammates can’t fetch the SHA. ([git-scm.com][2])

---

## 6  Typical pitfalls & how to avoid them

| Pitfall                                                   | Cure                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forgotten rights** – Dev joins iOS team but can’t build | Add them to the `ios-client.git` repo or team; no change needed in root repo.                                                                              |
| **Leaked secrets in root repo history**                   | Never commit real code or config here; enforce a pre-receive hook that scans for file additions larger than, say, 1 KB.                                    |
| **Relative URLs break when moving orgs**                  | In `.gitmodules`, prefer SSH URLs (`git@github.com:org/repo.git`) or HTTPS with `${GIT_TOKEN}` environment variable for CI.                                |
| **Nested submodule not updated**                          | Always pass `--recursive` to `git submodule update`, `git clone`, and `git pull`. ([stackoverflow.com][3], [stackoverflow.com][4])                         |
| **Private submodule in GitHub Actions fails**             | Use the `ssh-key` + `known_hosts` trick or `actions/checkout@v4` with `submodules: recursive` and a PAT that can read the private repo. ([github.com][10]) |

---

## 7  Migrating an existing monorepo

If you already have a single giant repo with folders that must be private:

1. **Split each folder into its own repo** with `git filter-repo --path <dir>/ --path-rename <dir>/:` or GitHub’s web UI for splitting. ([docs.github.com][14])
2. Replace the folder in the old repo by adding the new repo as a submodule at the same path.
3. Force-push the filtered repo to its new remote, then clean up the monorepo’s history if needed.

---

### Key take-aways

* Submodules don’t provide security by themselves; **the true access control lives in the sub-repositories**.
* GitHub/GitLab offer only repo-level read scopes, so splitting code is mandatory for confidentiality. ([docs.github.com][5], [docs.gitlab.com][7])
* For fine-grained path rules without splitting, self-host Gitolite or Gerrit. ([gitolite.com][11], [gerrit-review.googlesource.com][13])
* Use `--recursive` everywhere and script `git submodule update` to avoid surprises. ([git-scm.com][1], [stackoverflow.com][3])

Follow this design and each developer (or group) will see only the repositories—and therefore only the files—they’re entitled to, while you retain an umbrella “meta” repo that ties everything together.
