# Running ATL Transformations Outside Eclipse

This is a starup project for exercise 4.

It contains a **libs** folder with all the jars that are required to execute Acceleo transformations that have UML as the source metamodel.

The folder **tasks-nogen** includes ant tasks that can be used to run Acceleo transformations outside Eclipse.

### Running with ant

If you have [ant](http://ant.apache.org) installed in your system you can also use it. You will find a build.xml file with example target/tasks.
