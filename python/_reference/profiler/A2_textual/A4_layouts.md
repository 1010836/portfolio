This is an excellent and very common question that gets to the heart of how Textual's layout system works. You've stumbled upon a key principle: **the default sizing behavior of widgets.**

The reason the first `Input` takes all the horizontal space is that **by default, an `Input` widget is designed to be "greedy" and expand, while a `Button` is designed to be "polite" and shrink to fit its content.**

Let's break down the step-by-step layout negotiation that happens.

### The Layout Negotiation Process

Think of the `Horizontal` container as a manager that tries to fit its employees (the child widgets) into an office of a fixed width.

1.  **The Container Gets Its Space:** The `Horizontal(id="input-area")` container gets its total available width, which is likely 100% of the screen width.

2.  **The Container Asks Its Children for Their Sizes:** It goes through its children in order and asks them how wide they want to be.

    *   **Child 1: `Input(id="module-input")`**: The manager asks, "Input 1, how wide do you need to be?" An `Input` widget's default `width` is not fixed. It's a flexible widget. It effectively says, "I'll take as much space as you can give me!"

    *   **Child 2: `Button(id="browse-btn")`**: The manager asks, "Button, how wide do you need to be?" A `Button`'s default `width` is `auto`. It says, "I only need enough space for my label (`...`) plus a little bit of padding on the sides. No more." This is a very small, fixed amount of space.

    *   **Child 3: `Input(id="filter-input")`**: The manager asks, "Input 2, how wide do you need to be?" Just like the first `Input`, it also says, "I'll take as much space as you can give me!"

3.  **The Container Distributes the Space:** Now the manager has to make a decision.
    *   First, it allocates space for the "polite" widgets. It gives the `Button` the small width it requested.
    *   Then, it looks at the remaining space. There is a huge amount of width left.
    *   It looks at the "greedy," flexible widgets: the two `Input`s.
    *   Because the first `Input` (`#module-input`) is the **first flexible widget in line**, the layout engine gives **all of the remaining space** to it.
    *   By the time the layout engine gets to the third child (`#filter-input`), there is **zero space left**. Consequently, this input gets a width of 0 and is not rendered on the screen.

### The Solution: Use Fractional Units (`fr`)

To achieve your goal, you need to explicitly tell the container *how* to divide the space among its flexible children. The best way to do this is with the `fr` (fractional) unit in TCSS.

The `fr` unit tells a widget to take up a fraction of the *available flexible space*.

Here is the TCSS you need to add to fix this:

**`your_styles.tcss`**
```css
#input-area {
    /* This ensures the children are aligned vertically nicely */
    align: middle; 
}

/* Target both Input widgets inside the container */
#input-area > Input {
    /* Tell each Input to take 1 fraction of the available space */
    width: 1fr;
}

/* Target the button specifically */
#browse-btn {
    /* Let the button size itself to its content */
    width: auto;
    /* Add a little margin so it doesn't touch the inputs */
    margin: 0 1;
}
```

### How the Solution Works

With this CSS, the new negotiation process is:

1.  The `Horizontal` container gets its space.
2.  It asks the children for their sizes.
3.  The `Button` still says, "I need `auto` width (a small, fixed amount)."
4.  Both `Input` widgets now say, "My width is `1fr`."
5.  The container first allocates the small space for the `Button`.
6.  It then looks at the massive remaining space and sees two widgets that both want a "fraction." Since they both want `1fr`, it divides the remaining space **equally between them**.

### Alternative: Equal Thirds

If you wanted all three widgets, including the button, to have an equal share of the width, you could do this:

```css
#input-area > Widget {
    /* Target ALL direct children (Inputs and Button) */
    width: 1fr;
}
```

In this case, all three widgets would get exactly 1/3 of the total width.
