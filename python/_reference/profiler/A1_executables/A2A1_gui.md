Yes, absolutely. The solutions provided—**PyInstaller, Nuitka, and PyOxidizer**—are not only applicable but are the standard and most common methods for distributing desktop GUI applications written in Python.

Whether your app is a console UI made with Textual or a graphical desktop app made with **PyQt, PySide, Tkinter, Flet, Kivy, or wxPython**, the fundamental problem is the same: you have a Python script that you want to run on a user's machine without forcing them to install Python and your package's dependencies. Freezer applications are designed to solve exactly this problem.

### Key Differences for Desktop GUI Apps

While the overall process is the same, there are a few extra considerations that are critical for GUI applications:

1.  **Hiding the Console Window:** When a user double-clicks your app's icon, you don't want a black console window popping up behind your graphical interface. Freezer tools have specific flags to handle this.
    *   In **PyInstaller**, you use the `--windowed` or `--noconsole` flag.
    *   In **Nuitka**, you use `--disable-console`.

2.  **Including Assets (Icons, Images, Fonts):** GUI applications almost always rely on external assets. You need to tell the freezer to include these files and know how to find them at runtime.
    *   **Bundling:** Tools like PyInstaller have flags like `--add-data` to bundle asset files and folders.
    *   **Runtime Path:** When your app is frozen, it gets unpacked to a temporary directory. You can't use relative paths like `images/icon.png`. Your code must be written to find the assets in that temporary location.

3.  **Application Icon:** You will want to assign a custom `.ico` (on Windows) or `.icns` (on macOS) file to your final executable. All freezer tools support this with a flag like `--icon`.

### The Best Tools for Desktop GUI Apps

The ranking remains largely the same, but with a new contender that is specifically focused on application deployment.

#### 1. PyInstaller (The Go-To Standard)
This is the most battle-tested and widely used tool for packaging Python GUI applications. It has excellent out-of-the-box support for all major GUI toolkits.

*   **Why it's #1 for GUIs:** It has pre-configured "hooks" that automatically detect and correctly bundle the complex libraries and plugins required by frameworks like PyQt/PySide and Kivy.
*   **Example Command for a GUI App:**
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon="assets/app.ico" --add-data="assets;assets" main.py
    ```    *   `--onefile`: Creates a single executable.
    *   `--windowed`: Prevents the console from appearing on launch.
    *   `--icon="assets/app.ico"`: Sets the application icon.
    *   `--add-data="assets;assets"`: Bundles the entire `assets` folder into a folder named `assets` inside your final package. (The separator is `;` on Windows and `:` on Linux/macOS).

#### 2. Nuitka (The Performance Option)
Nuitka is also an excellent choice for GUI apps. Because it compiles your Python code to C, it can sometimes provide a noticeable performance boost and faster startup times, which is a great benefit for user-facing applications.

*   **Why choose it for GUIs:** If your application is computationally intensive or if startup time is critical, Nuitka can offer a superior result.
*   **Example Command for a GUI App:**
    ```bash
    python -m nuitka --standalone --onefile --disable-console --windows-icon-from-ico=assets/app.ico --include-data-dir=assets=assets main.py
    ```

#### 3. Briefcase (The Modern App Deployer)
Briefcase is part of the BeeWare suite of tools and is designed from the ground up to package Python applications for distribution, not just freeze scripts. It goes a step further by creating native installers (`.msi` on Windows, `.dmg` on macOS) and can handle code signing.

*   **Why it's a great choice:** Briefcase is less of a "freezer" and more of a full deployment tool. It sets up a project with a standard template and handles packaging your app in a way that feels native to the host operating system. It's an excellent choice if you plan to distribute your app formally.
*   **How it works:** You use commands like `briefcase create`, `briefcase build`, and `briefcase run`. The configuration is handled in your `pyproject.toml` file.

### Example: Packaging a Simple GUI App

Let's say you have a simple PySide6 app.

**1. Your Project Structure:**
```
my_gui_app/
├── main.py
└── assets/
    └── app.ico
```

**2. Your `main.py` code (with logic to find assets):**
```python
import sys
import os
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

# This function is crucial for finding assets when frozen
def resource_path(relative_path):
    """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller """
    try:
        # PyInstaller creates a temp folder and stores path in _MEIPASS
        base_path = sys._MEIPASS
    except Exception:
        base_path = os.path.abspath(".")

    return os.path.join(base_path, relative_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    
    # You would use resource_path() to load images, icons, etc.
    # For example:
    # window.setWindowIcon(QIcon(resource_path("assets/app.ico")))
    
    label = QLabel("Hello, Desktop App!")
    label.show()
    
    sys.exit(app.exec())
```

**3. The PyInstaller Command:**
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "MyCoolApp" --icon="assets/app.ico" main.py
```

After running this command, you will find `MyCoolApp.exe` inside the `dist` folder, ready to be distributed.
