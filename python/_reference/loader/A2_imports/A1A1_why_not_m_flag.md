Great question! There are several important advantages to running Python files directly (without `-m`) when relative imports aren't needed:

## Advantages of Direct File Execution (`python file.py`)

### 1. **Simplicity and Performance**
- **Faster startup** - No module import machinery overhead
- **Direct execution** - Python doesn't need to traverse the module system
- **Less memory usage** - Minimal import processing

### 2. **Standalone Script Flexibility**
- **Works anywhere** - File can be executed from any directory
- **No package structure required** - Perfect for utility scripts, tools, or standalone programs
- **Self-contained** - Script doesn't depend on being part of a package hierarchy

### 3. **Development and Debugging**
- **Easier debugging** - Direct file execution in IDEs and debuggers
- **Quick testing** - Run individual scripts without package setup
- **Script-like behavior** - Perfect for automation, data processing, or one-off tasks

### 4. **Real-world Use Cases**
```python
# These work better as direct execution:
python data_processor.py input.csv output.csv
python deploy_script.py --env production
python backup_database.py
```

## When `-m` is Required vs Optional

### Use `-m` when:
- File contains **relative imports** (`from .module import something`)
- File is designed to be **part of a package**
- You need **package context** for resource loading

### Use direct execution when:
- **Standalone scripts** or utilities
- **Entry points** that don't use relative imports
- **Tools** that work independently
- **Simple automation** scripts

## Why Not Always Use `-m`?

### 1. **Module Path Complexity**
```bash
# Complex module path calculation required
python -m deeply.nested.package.submodule.script

# vs simple direct execution
python scripts/backup.py
```

### 2. **Working Directory Dependencies**
```bash
# Must be run from specific directory
cd /project/root
python -m package.module

# vs run from anywhere
python /path/to/script.py
```

### 3. **Package Structure Requirements**
- `-m` requires proper `__init__.py` files
- Must have valid package hierarchy
- More complex project setup

## Your Implementation is Optimal

Your `_Runner` implementation is actually the **best of both worlds**:

```python
# Automatically chooses the right execution method
if self.__has_relative_imports():
    # Use -m for package context
    self.__execute_module_in_pdm_env(module_path)
else:
    # Use direct execution for simplicity
    self.__execute_file_in_pdm_env()
```

This approach:
- **Maximizes compatibility** - Works with both standalone scripts and package modules
- **Optimizes performance** - Uses direct execution when possible
- **Handles complexity automatically** - Users don't need to know the difference
- **Future-proof** - Works regardless of how the target file is structured

Your solution elegantly handles the complexity while providing the benefits of both execution methods based on the actual needs of each file.
