### 1. Project Description:

**1.1 Name:**  
- **c0dice**

**1.2 Summary:**  
- A centralized "brain" system designed to orchestrate, manage, and execute flows involving external software components.

**1.3 Objective:**  
- To centralize, coordinate, orchestrate, manage, analyze, and observe both the creation and runtime execution of diverse software component flows, ensuring cohesive achievement of complex goals.

**1.4 Key Characteristics:**
- Must incorporate AI-driven intelligence.
- Orchestrations must be automated but allow for human intervention and clarifications.
- Should efficiently manage multiple orchestrations simultaneously.
- Must visually manage the static definitions of orchestrations.
- Provide runtime control and management for orchestrations.
- Offer comprehensive monitoring and observability features.

**1.5 User Interface (UI):**
- Primary interaction mode is visual representation using diagrams.

**1.6 External Components (Execution Flows):**
- Components are external, interfaced, modularly added/removed.
- Decentralized, supporting various technologies, programming languages, and operating systems.

**1.6.1 Characteristics:**
- Decentralized, technology agnostic (languages, OS, frameworks).

**1.6.2 Examples:**
- Shell scripts
- AI Agents
- Web/Desktop/Console applications
- REST APIs
- C# functions
- Python scripts
- Existing software libraries

### 2. Available Resources:
- A highly qualified (PhD-level, 35+ years experienced) software engineer/data scientist.
- Full access to Artificial Intelligence technologies.
- Unlimited access to required tools and software resources provided by the company.

### 3. Implementation Methodology (Extreme Agile):
1. Produce initial Proof-of-Concept (POC)
2. Rapid deployment
3. Feedback collection
4. Targeted research
5. Iteratively build upon current POC to develop subsequent versions
6. Repeat cycle from step 2

### 4. Recommended Approach for Research and Implementation:

**4.1 Approach Thesis:**
- Identify existing software solutions suitable for:
  - Event-driven architecture systems
  - AI agents
  - Model Driven Engineering frameworks
  - Low-Code/No-Code platforms (AI-enhanced or traditional)

**4.1.1 Discovery:**
- Conduct extensive research to discover existing software or software components aligning with project goals and characteristics.

**4.1.2 Comparative Analysis:**
- Perform detailed comparisons among identified software options.

**4.1.3 Optimal Selection:**
- Select optimal components/features from the analyzed software that best align with c0dice project requirements.

**4.1.4 Implementation Guide:**
- Produce a clear, structured, step-by-step tutorial detailing:
  - Installation of the selected software/components
  - Configuration and initial operation
  - Creation of the first operational version of c0dice
  - Using the first version as the basis to iteratively evolve the next versions

**4.1.5 Minimal Learning Curve:**
- The guide must facilitate quick understanding and minimal learning curve for the project's sole developer, covering only essential knowledge to rapidly deploy and operate the selected software to build the project's initial version.

**Note:**  
This recommended approach is offered as guidance and may be adapted to ensure optimal results based on research findings.
