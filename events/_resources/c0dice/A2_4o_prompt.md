**Project Overview:**

- **Name:** c0dice
- **Summary:** An intelligent system designed to orchestrate, manage, and execute flows of external software components, acting as the central hub for execution processes.

**Objectives:**

1. **Centralization:** Coordinate and oversee the creation and execution of workflows involving multiple software components to achieve unified goals.
2. **Automation:** Implement AI-driven automation for seamless orchestration.
3. **Human Interaction:** Incorporate mechanisms for human intervention and clarification when necessary.
4. **Multi-Orchestration Management:** Enable the handling of multiple orchestrations simultaneously.
5. **Visual Management:** Provide visual tools for both the static definition and dynamic control of orchestrations.
6. **Monitoring:** Offer robust monitoring and observability features.

**User Interface:**

- Primarily visual, utilizing diagrams for display and interaction.

**Execution Flow Components:**

- **Nature:** External to the system, integrated via interfaces allowing addition and removal.
- **Characteristics:** Decentralized, supporting diverse technologies, programming languages, and operating systems.
- **Examples:** Shell scripts, AI agents, web/desktop/console applications, REST APIs, C# functions, Python scripts, existing software libraries, etc.

**Available Resources:**

1. A highly experienced software engineer/data scientist with a PhD and 35 years of experience.
2. Access to Artificial Intelligence tools.
3. Provision of necessary tools/software by the company.

**Implementation Methodology:**

- **Extreme AGILE Approach:**
  1. Develop a Proof of Concept (POC).
  2. Deploy the POC.
  3. Gather feedback.
  4. Conduct research based on feedback.
  5. Utilize the current POC to inform the next iteration.
  6. Repeat from step 2.

**Proposed Approach:**

1. **Discovery:** Identify existing software or components relevant to implementing:
   - Event-driven systems
   - AI agents
   - Model-Driven Engineering
   - Low/No-Code applications (with or without AI)
2. **Comparison:** Evaluate the discovered software to select the most suitable components.
3. **Integration Guide:** Develop a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on creating the initial version of the system using the selected software, including installation and operation instructions, to facilitate rapid development.
