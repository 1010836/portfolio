**"Generate a detailed technical report that identifies and justifies the best solution for enabling dynamic integration of client-deployed custom engines into an existing Python application deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The application architecture includes a REST API with fixed scaling, a Redis queue, and Celery workers that scale using KEDA. Each worker processes tasks using a standard engine. The new requirement is to allow clients to develop and deploy their own custom engines, adhering to a provided standard interface, without modifying the core application or its deployment process. Each task in the Redis queue specifies which engine to use. I donÂ´t know if removing the Celery and just scale with K8s is a better choice, include this option in you analysis.
The report should:**

1. **Evaluate and compare possible solutions, such as dynamic module loading, plugin architectures, and containerized deployments.**
2. **Justify the selected solution based on scalability, security, maintainability, and ease of integration.**
3. **Provide a step-by-step implementation guide for the chosen solution, including:**

   * **Code snippets (Python, PowerShell, etc.) for dynamic loading or execution of custom engines.**
   * **Instructions for clients to package and deploy their custom engines.**
   * **Modifications required in the Celery worker setup to support dynamic engine selection and execution.**
4. **Discuss security considerations and best practices for executing untrusted client code within the system.**
5. **Include diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the architecture and data flow if applicable."**([Maker Forge][1])

### ðŸ§  Additional Tips for Effective Research

* **Be Specific**: Clearly define the technologies involved (e.g., Python, Celery, Redis, KEDA, AKS) to ensure the research is tailored to your stack.

* **Security Focus**: Emphasize the need to securely execute untrusted client code, possibly exploring sandboxing techniques or container isolation.

* **Dynamic Loading**: Highlight the requirement for dynamic loading of client-provided engines at runtime, adhering to a standard interface.

* **Deployment Independence**: Stress that client engine deployment should be independent of the core application deployment process.
