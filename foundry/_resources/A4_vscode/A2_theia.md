# can I use Theia?

can I do all this with Thea the open source vscode alternative?

Yes ‚Äî **Eclipse Theia** (an open‚Äësource alternative to VS‚ÄØCode) now supports Dev Containers, meaning you can achieve the same smooth ‚Äúdevelop inside a container‚Äù workflow using Theia instead of VS‚ÄØCode.

---

## üöÄ Theia‚Äôs Dev Container Support

* **Since Theia 1.49**, Theia IDE supports VS‚ÄØCode-style `devcontainer.json` configurations. When you open a workspace that has this file, Theia can **launch or attach** to the defined Docker container and mount your repo directly into it ([notebookcheck.net][1]).
* It handles **port forwarding**, automatic container launching, and workspace mounting‚Äîjust like VS‚ÄØCode, though this feature is still maturing and currently covers core use cases .

---

## üîÑ Team Workflow in Theia

1. Add the `.devcontainer/` folder + `devcontainer.json` / `Dockerfile` to your repo. Same structure as VS‚ÄØCode uses.
2. Team developers open the project in Theia (desktop or browser):

   * Theia prompts to reopen in the Dev Container.
3. The configured Docker container launches, with your code mounted.
4. Inside Theia, you get:

   * Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for Python, Node, etc.
   * Installed extensions (Theia supports most VS‚ÄØCode plugins via Open VSX).
   * Git, build tools, debug experience‚Äîall inside the container.
5. Everyone on the team uses the same isolated container environment, with no local installs beyond Docker and Theia itself.

## ‚úÖ Key Benefits & Considerations

| Feature                             | Outcome in Theia                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev Container compatibility**     | Supported in 1.49+ release; auto container launch from `.devcontainer` ([code.visualstudio.com][2], [notebookcheck.net][1], [docs.nav2.org][3], [theia-ide.org][4], [gitpod.io][5], [code.visualstudio.com][6], [eclipsesource.com][7]) |
| **VS‚ÄØCode extension compatibility** | Most plugins work, using the Open VSX registry                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **UI experience**                   | Similar to VS‚ÄØCode: sidebar, editors, LSP support via Docker-backed back end                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Maturity**                        | Still experimental; core features like mounts, port forwarding, and extensions are supported                                                                                                                                            |
| **Host requirements**               | Just Docker and Theia (desktop/web version) ‚Äî no VS‚ÄØCode needed                                                                                                                                                                         |

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Yes**, you can use Theia to develop inside Docker Dev Containers, just like with VS‚ÄØCode.
* You use the **exact same config** (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and Dockerfile).
* Theia will start the container, mount your code, install extensions, and connect via LSP‚Äîall within the Docker container.
* Great open-source option if you prefer Theia or want a browser-based IDE experience.
