# 1. azure RBAC my app?

can I use azure entra ID system to create and manage the RBAC for my app?

Absolutely ‚Äî you can use **Azure (Microsoft Entra)‚ÄØID** to configure RBAC for your application. Here‚Äôs how it works and why it‚Äôs effective:

---

### üîë Concepts & Capabilities

#### 1. Entra ID Roles ‚â† Azure‚Äëresource RBAC

* Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD) roles let you manage identity objects‚Äîlike users, groups, app registrations, and enterprise apps.
* These are separate from Azure Resource Manager RBAC, which controls access to Azure services like VMs and storage ([youtube.com][1]).

#### 2. App‚Äëspecific Roles for Your Application

* In your app registration (‚ÄúApp Roles‚Äù section), you define application roles such as `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`, etc. ([reddit.com][2]).
* Once roles are defined and enabled, you assign them‚Äîeither to individual users, security groups, or service principals. The roles show up in the user‚Äôs token as the `roles` claim.
* Within your application, you read `roles` and enforce authZ using your framework's native support (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles="Admin")]` in ASP.NET Core) ([youtube.com][3]).

#### 3. Group‚Äëbased Role Assignment

* Instead of assigning roles directly to users, you can assign them via groups. Tokens will include either `roles` claims or `groups` claims, depending on which mechanism you use .

#### 4. Two Patterns for App-Level RBAC

| Pattern       | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **App Roles** | Roles are defined per-app, enforced via the `roles` claim. Recommended and supported by MS identity SDKs . |
| **Groups**    | Use group membership as roles‚Äîless fine‚Äëtuned, subject to token claim overage limits .                     |

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Setup

1. **Define app roles** in your Azure portal under your App Registration ‚Üí *App Roles*.
2. **Assign these roles** to users or groups in *Enterprise Applications* ‚Üí *Users and Groups*.
3. **Implement enforcement** in code by checking token claims using your authentication framework (e.g., ASP.NET Core, Java, NodeJS).
4. Optionally, **use Azure AD P1/P2 features** like Privileged Identity Management and administrative scopes to govern role assignment and compliance .

### TL;DR

Yes ‚Äî **Azure Entra ID supports RBAC for your app** via the App Roles feature. You define roles, assign them to identities (users/groups), and enforce them via claims in your application. It‚Äôs officially supported, straightforward, and aligns with Microsoft‚Äôs best practices.

# 2. CEGID oauth2?

my company has it's own oauth2 server can I connect my company user that I get from this server to the RBAC for my app created with entra ID?

Yes, you *can* connect users from your own OAuth2 server to manage RBAC in your Entra ID‚Äìbased application‚Äîbut you‚Äôll need the right configuration flow. Here‚Äôs how:

---

## üîó Option 1: Use **Azure AD B2C** as a federation broker (recommended)

Azure AD B2C supports connecting **generic OAuth2/OpenID Connect identity providers**, including your on‚Äëprem or private OAuth2 server. You can:

1. In your B2C tenant, follow instructions to **add a generic OAuth2** provider to your user flow or custom policy.
2. B2C acts as the authentication broker‚Äîusers from your company OAuth2 sign in, and B2C issues tokens enriched with app roles defined in Entra ID. ([help.zscaler.com][1], [learn.microsoft.com][2])
3. You define your **App Roles** in your app registration in B2C or Entra ID. Users federated via your OAuth2 provider get those roles in their tokens. ([learn.microsoft.com][3])

This approach lets you leverage your OAuth2 server identity and still use Entra-based RBAC seamlessly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Option 2: Use **Azure AD External (B2B) Identities**

Azure B2B allows you to invite external users‚Äîbut only via federation with other Azure AD tenants or via email invites. You *can‚Äôt* directly connect a custom OAuth2 server this way. B2B is for guest collaboration, not generic OAuth federation. ([learn.microsoft.com][4])

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* ‚úÖ **Goal**: Users authenticate via your OAuth2 server ‚Üí can be authorized using Entra ID App Roles.
* ‚ùå **Direct federation to Azure AD (B2B)** won‚Äôt work.
* ‚úÖ **Azure AD B2C with generic OAuth2 provider** is the proper solution‚Äîyou get federated login and then issue tokens with Entra-based App Roles for your app.

---

### Next Steps

* Spin up an **Azure AD B2C** tenant (note: new subscriptions may be disabled for this).
* Register your app, define *App Roles*.
* Add your company OAuth2 server as a **generic OAuth2/OpenID provider** in user flows.
* Assign or group users to roles in B2C/Entra ID.
* In your app, enforce authorization using token `roles` claims.
