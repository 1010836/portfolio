# 1. browser inside chat?

I sow that the agents tool of Open AI and the Manus agent etc integrate a browser directly inside 
their AI chatbot to automatically execute agentic tasks how can I do that inside my chatbot app?

If you're aiming to equip your chatbot app with an intelligent agent that can autonomously execute browser tasks‚Äîlike OpenAI‚Äôs **Operator** or Manus AI‚Äîyou can absolutely build that, and here‚Äôs how:

---

## üöÄ 1. Use OpenAI‚Äôs Agentic Framework

OpenAI offers a suite of tools designed specifically for building agents:

* **Responses API**: Supports using built-in tools ‚Äì web search, file search, and **computer use** (i.e., browser automation) ‚Äì in a single call ([openai.com][1]).
* **Agents SDK**: Orchestrates workflows involving multiple agents, tool calls, and condition handling ([openai.com][1]).
* These let your chatbot not just reply, but **act**: browse pages, click, type, handle forms‚Äîjust like ChatGPT‚Äôs Operator .

You would generally:

1. Integrate the **Responses API**, specifying tools like `"computer_use"` and `"web_search_preview"`.
2. Use the SDK to manage agent behavior‚Äîwhen to search, when to browse, decision loops.
3. Host this agent inside your chatbot backend, exposing its capabilities via UI.

## üß∞ 2. Leverage Browser Automation Libraries

If you want full control, combine your LLM with browser-automation libraries:

* Popular choices: **Playwright**, **Puppeteer**, **Selenium** ([wired.com][2], [nordicapis.com][3], [medium.com][4]).
* Architecture outline:

  1. User asks chatbot to perform a task.
  2. Chatbot sends instructions to LLM (e.g., GPT‚Äë4o).
  3. LLM outputs structured commands (`click #login`, `type #search ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù`).
  4. Your server runs these commands via Playwright (or Puppeteer/Selenium).
  5. The LLM reviews results (page snapshots, DOM) and continues the workflow.
  6. Return results or status to user.

This mimics how Operator works‚Äîweb automation driven by LLM commands ([nordicapis.com][3], [medium.com][4], [reddit.com][5], [wired.com][2], [arstechnica.com][6]).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Consider Complete Agent Platforms

If you want a faster path or more abstraction, look at open-source frameworks:

* **AutoGPT**, **Agent‚ÄëS**, **OpenManus**: link LLM intents to tool execution, including web interactions ([arxiv.org][7]).
* These provide base agent frameworks; you‚Äôll still need to plug in a browser tool.

## üîç 4. Build Flow Overview

| Component                  | What It Does                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM + Agent SDK**        | Plans tasks, decides tool usage (search or click) |
| **Browser automation lib** | Executes actions on real websites                 |
| **Backend**                | Coordinates calls, error handling, flow logic     |
| **Chatbot frontend**       | Sends user tasks, receives updates or results     |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Steps to Start

1. **Choose your stack**:

   * Go with OpenAI's built-in toolchain (Responses API + Agents SDK).
   * Or self-manage commands + use Playwright/Selenium manually.

2. **Prototype script**:

   * Example: ‚ÄúSearch flights‚Äù with LLM generating browser commands.
   * Execute via automation lib, fetch results.

3. **Layer reliability**:

   * Add error handling, retries, guardrails.
   * Ask user for confirmation for certain actions (e.g. purchases).

4. **Deploy & monitor**:

   * Run agent server (uploadable function or container).
   * Wrap flow inside your chatbot UI, and monitor with logging.

5. **Scale thoughtfully**:

   * Add observability tools from Agent SDK.
   * Expand to multi-agent flows (e.g., search agent + booking agent).

---

## üèÅ TL;DR

* For fastest path: use **OpenAI Responses API** + **Agents SDK** + `"computer_use"` tool.
* For full control: pair GPT‚Äë4o with **Playwright/Puppeteer/Selenium**.
* Optionally: utilize open-source frameworks like **AutoGPT** or **Agent‚ÄëS** to bootstrap workflows.

# 2. foundry?

can I do this using foundry AI in azure?

Yes, you **can** create agentic chatbots using Azure‚Äôs Foundry AI‚Äîbut with some caveats: it doesn‚Äôt come with an *internal browser automation tool* out of the box. Here‚Äôs how you can set it up:

---

## 1. ‚úÖ What Azure AI Foundry Offers Natively

* **Agent Service** supports multi-step, autonomous workflows logic, API calls, retrieval, and chaining ([youtube.com][1], [mobilize.net][2]).
* You can design agents that:

  * Search customer databases
  * Call external APIs
  * Generate responses with context and citations
  * Use telemetry, security, observability tools ([learn.microsoft.com][3], [azure.microsoft.com][4])

üé• Here's a demo showing how to build agentic solutions in Azure AI Foundry:

---

## 2. ü§ñ How to Add Browser Automation

Azure Foundry **does not include** a built-in browser automation tool like Operator. But you can integrate one yourself:

1. Deploy an agent via Azure AI Foundry.
2. Set its responses to emit structured "actions" (e.g., `CLICK`, `TYPE`, `NAVIGATE`).
3. Create a backend service (e.g., in Azure Functions or container) that:

   * Takes the action plan from the agent.
   * Uses a browser automation library (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium) to perform these in a real or headless browser.
   * Returns screenshots, status, extracted content back to the agent.
4. The agent continues the workflow based on those results‚Äîjust like ChatGPT Operator.

## 3. üß© Integration Patterns

You have two main approaches:

| Option           | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom**       | Use Azure SDK and REST APIs: Agent ‚Üí backend service ‚Üí browser lib ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí respond                                    |
| **Semi‚Äëmanaged** | Use hybrid: Foundry for orchestration + low-code via Logic Apps or Make.com connectors, with a backend automation layer |

‚ÄúFor integration with Teams or Bot Framework, point your Bot‚Äôs **Messaging Endpoint** to the Foundry Agent‚Äôs endpoint‚Äù ([youtube.com][1], [schneider.im][5], [learn.microsoft.com][6]).

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Recommended Approach

* Use **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** to build, secure, monitor your agent logic.
* **Implement a backend microservice** (Azure Function or container) to handle browser automation with Playwright/Puppeteer.
* Use Foundry SDK or REST API to orchestrate calls.
* Deploy your chatbot front‚Äëend with secure routing to Foundry agents (APIM, Functions, Bot Framework, etc.).

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* Azure Foundry enables agent workflows and logic, but **no native browser automation**.
* You *can* integrate browser control via your backend using standard tools.
* Combine Foundry‚Äôs orchestration + your automation service = powerful agentic chatbot with browser skills.
* If you want help building a template or starting code, just say the word!
