# 1. canvas inside chat?

and what about the canvas option where we can run code 
generated by the LLM directly inside the chatbot does foundry as features to do this?

Azure AI Foundry **does** include a ‚Äúcanvas‚Äù feature‚Äîcalled **Prompt Flow** or **visual flow designer**‚Äîwhere you can build, debug, and run LLM-powered logic visually, including running code directly within the flow. Here's what that means and how it aligns with what you're looking to do:

---

## üß™ 1. Prompt Flow = Visual ‚ÄúCanvas with Code Execution‚Äù

* Foundry‚Äôs **Prompt Flow** is a visual editor where you drag and connect nodes to create a workflow. These nodes can include:

  * Text prompts (LLM calls)
  * API calls
  * **Python script steps** that execute code inline
    ([learn.microsoft.com][1], [learn.microsoft.com][2])

* It supports **executable flows**: define logic, run it, debug it, iterate, and even export them as API endpoints


---

## üßë‚Äçüíª 2. Code Interpreter (Sandboxed Python Execution)

* Foundry‚Äôs **Code Interpreter** tool lets your agent or flow **generate and run Python code** during execution. It supports:

  * Iterative code tuning
  * Data analysis (CSV, JSON, images, etc.)
  * Debugging via the canvas
    ([learn.microsoft.com][3], [learn.microsoft.com][1])

* This is similar to ChatGPT‚Äôs Code Interpreter but built into Foundry‚Äôs Agent Service/flows. It lets LLM-generated code run directly inside your chatbot workflow.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Can Do with Canvas + Code

* **Visually build** multi-step conversation or automation logic.
* At any node, include **custom Python** (e.g., data processing, API calls, business logic).
* **Run and debug** your code inline‚Äîchecking results at each step‚Äîbefore deploying.
* **Deploy** the final flow as a REST endpoint or integrate it into your chatbot.

---

## üîß How to Get Started

1. **Open the Foundry portal** ‚Üí build a **Prompt Flow** (aka canvas).
2. Add nodes for:

   * LLM prompts
   * Code Interpreter nodes to run Python
   * API/tool calls or other custom logic
     ([learn.microsoft.com][4], [mobilize.net][5], [learn.microsoft.com][1], [vipin-tyagi.medium.com][6])
3. **Iterate & test**: run your flow with sample input, inspect outputs step-by-step.
4. **Deploy**: publish your flow as an endpoint and call it from your chatbot or app.

---

### üß© So to sum up:

Yes‚Äîyou *can* run code generated by the LLM **directly inside** your chatbot's flow via Foundry‚Äôs **Prompt Flow canvas** paired with the **Code Interpreter** tool. It gives you a full low-code + code-enabled environment to build autonomous, testable, and deployable chat agents.
