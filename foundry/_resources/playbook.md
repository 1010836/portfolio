# 1. WHAT

A “playbook” here is an executable procedure in Markdown: 
    a concise, 
    versioned set of step‑by‑step instructions (rules + sequencing) 
    for a recurring engineering task 
    (editing code, generating tests, producing diagrams, releasing).

Why use the term:
- Standardized repeatable workflow (minimize deviation).
- Shared source of truth for both humans and automation (agents read it).
- Encapsulates task scope, constraints, and acceptance checks.
- Keeps the Core Invariants file minimal by moving task‑specific details out.
- Enables modular “task routing” (pick the right playbook, then follow it exactly).

In short: playbooks = procedural task guides optimized for consistency, automation, and low cognitive load.

# 2. WHY

Below are authoritative sources using “playbook” (and how they frame it) so you can compare with your internal use of “workflow.”

1. Atlassian (Incident management playbooks)  
   Purpose: Prepared, versioned procedural guides for incident response.  
   https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response/playbooks

2. PagerDuty (Incident Response Playbook)  
   Emphasizes repeatable, standardized actions for responders.  
   https://response.pagerduty.com/playbooks/incident_response/

3. Microsoft (Security / Deployment / Adoption playbooks)  
   “Playbook” = prescriptive, reusable guidance packages (not just a flow engine).  
   Example (Defender / security operations playbooks): https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/security-operations  
   Adoption playbooks overview: https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/

4. Google SRE Workbook (Runbook vs. Playbook distinction; procedural docs)  
   Uses “playbook/runbook” as curated step lists for known scenarios.  
   https://sre.google/sre-book/ (see “Operational Overload,” “Incident Response” chapters)

5. AWS (Playbooks in incident & resilience guidance)  
   Defines playbooks as documented, scenario-based response procedures.  
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/playbooks-and-runbooks.html

6. Red Hat (Ansible Playbooks)  
   Formalizes “playbook” as declarative, ordered sets of tasks (codified procedure).  
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/index.html

7. HashiCorp (Terraform / Ops playbooks blog & examples)  
   Treats playbooks as codified operational procedures enabling repeatability.  
   https://www.hashicorp.com/blog (search “playbook” in ops & reliability posts)

8. IBM (Runbooks & Playbooks in automation)  
   Differentiates playbooks as structured guidance for automating recurring tasks.  
   https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-management/ (search “playbook runbook”)

9. GitHub (Security / response playbooks; enterprise guidance)  
   “Playbook” = documented, reusable guidance for responding to classes of events.  
   https://github.com/github/incident-response (public example repository)

Conceptual distinction (synthesis):
- Workflow: Orchestrated sequence (often tool/execution–centric). Focus = flow of states/tasks (could be BPMN, pipelines, state machines). Usually system-enforced or engine-driven.
- Playbook: Human + automation facing procedural guide (codified “how,” context, decision points, acceptance criteria). Often includes rationale, branching guidance, guardrails. Can instruct how to execute or trigger one or more workflows.

Mapping them together:
- A workflow engine run = an execution instance.
- A playbook = the curated specification telling an engineer/agent which workflow(s) to run, in what order, with what preconditions and acceptance checks.

Why teams keep “playbook” separate from “workflow”:
- Adds decision context, fallback paths, escalation rules (often not modeled directly in a narrow workflow definition).
- Easier to version and review as prose + structured steps before (or alongside) automating pieces.
- Serves dual audience: humans (situational judgment) and automation (bounded procedural scope).

If you standardize on “workflow,” you can still:
- Keep your prose guides but rename “playbooks” → “workflow guides.”
- Or reserve “workflow” for engine/Pipeline definitions and “playbook” for higher-level operational procedures.

Good practices (concise):
- Separate policy (guardrails) from execution code; load at runtime.
- Log reasoning + selected actions (privacy-scrubbed) for audit.
- Enforce tool schema validation both pre- and post-call.
- Hard ceilings on recursion/loop iterations (prevent runaway).
- Dual evaluation: capability (benchmarks) + alignment (safety tests).
- Structured refusal patterns with deterministic triggers.
- Maintain a Red Team test bundle; run before each major release.
- Immutable artifacts (model, prompt template, tool manifest) hashed & recorded.

# 4. Context

**Summary differences**

AI Playbook:
- Scope: End-to-end procedure (people + tools + models) for a recurring task or lifecycle (plan, inputs, guardrails, execution steps, evaluation, fallback, escalation).
- Contents: Purpose, roles, preconditions, tool registry, control flow, safety policies, metrics, incident handling, improvement loop.
- Persistence: Stable, versioned operational artifact.
- Audience: Humans + automation/orchestration layer.
- Granularity: Multi-step workflow; may reference multiple prompts/models.

AI Prompt (user prompt):
- Scope: Single interaction instruction to a model.
- Contents: Immediate task/context phrasing, examples, constraints.
- Lifecycle: Disposable or templated; updated frequently.
- Audience: Model only (via interface/API).
- Granularity: One turn (or a single message in a conversation).

AI System Prompt (a.k.a. system / foundation instruction):
- Scope: Foundational role + global behavioral constraints for a session/agent.
- Contents: Role, tone, hard rules, refusal policy, formatting requirements.
- Lifecycle: Less frequently changed; defines session-wide contract.
- Audience: Model (as highest-precedence instruction in conversation stack).
- Granularity: Persistent across turns; other prompts layer on top.

**Key distinctions**

- Time horizon: Playbook (long-lived process) vs prompt (single task) vs system prompt (session baseline).
- Coverage: Playbook includes governance + evaluation; prompts do not.
- Composition: Playbook can orchestrate many prompts and tools; prompts are atomic.
- Change frequency: Playbook low-moderate, system prompt low, user prompt high.
- Enforcement: Playbook relies on human/agent adherence; system prompt enforced by model instruction hierarchy.

**Relationship**

Playbook defines WHEN and HOW to generate/use WHICH prompts (system + user) and WHAT to do with outputs (validation, escalation). Prompts implement the micro-level instructions inside the macro procedure defined by the playbook.
