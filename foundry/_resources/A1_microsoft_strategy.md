# 1. keep semantic kernel?

Is Microsoft going to keep semantic kernel or is it going to be discontinued?

## 2. answer

Microsoft is **definitely not discontinuing Semantic Kernel** ‚Äî quite the opposite, it‚Äôs being **heavily invested in and promoted as a core part of Microsoft‚Äôs AI strategy**:

---

### ‚úÖ Strong Signs Semantic Kernel Is Here to Stay

#### 1. **Recent Official Commitment**

In a blog post just **last week**, Microsoft reaffirmed that Semantic Kernel (SK) is *central to their enterprise AI story*, with ongoing feature additions and a stable API. They emphasize it's their "production-ready, stable framework" and will continue evolving through integration with AutoGen and interoperability efforts ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).

#### 2. **Agent Framework Hits GA**

Microsoft announced that SK‚Äôs **Agent framework is now Generally Available** (GA) as of **April 4, 2025** in versions 1.45 (.NET) and 1.27 (Python). GA status means a stable, supported API surface for enterprise applications ([devblogs.microsoft.com][2]).

#### 3. **H1 2025 Roadmap and v1.0**

The **H1 2025 roadmap** outlines plans to release SK's core Process Framework out of preview by **end of Q2 2025**, moving toward v1.0, which signals long-term support and stability ([devblogs.microsoft.com][3]).

#### 4. **Merging with AutoGen & Extensions.ai**

SK is being aligned and merged with **AutoGen**, **Microsoft.Extensions.AI**, and other AI toolkits ‚Äî not sunset. They‚Äôre consolidating technologies for a unified agentic AI toolkit ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).

---

### üíº 2. Productivity Push: Copilots & Agentic AI

* Launched **GitHub Copilot** (June 2021) and **Microsoft 365 Copilot** (Mar 2023), integrating LLMs into developer tools and Office apps ([laptopmag.com][5]).
* Bing Chat, internally called "Sydney," leveraged Microsoft Prometheus model‚Äîshowing early agentic capabilities ([en.wikipedia.org][6]).

---

### üîó 3. Unified Strategy: Azure AI Foundry

* **Ignite 2024**: Announced Azure AI Foundry (formerly Azure AI Studio) as a unified portal + SDK to build, evaluate, and deploy AI apps and agents ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][3]).
* It consolidates Azure OpenAI, AI search, content safety, and agent services, offering features like:

  * **Model catalog**: frontier and open-source models
  * **Agent SDK**: orchestration using Semantic Kernel and AutoGen
  * **Observability & governance**: tracing, identity (Purview/Entra), and compliance ([azure.microsoft.com][7], [windowsforum.com][8]).
* **Generally available** now at ai.azure.com, with Python/C# SDK (JS coming soon) ([azure.microsoft.com][9]).

---

### üß© 4. State‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚ÄëArt Platform

# 5. foundry?

So the current Microsoft AI strategy is based on AI foundry? 

Yes ‚Äî **Microsoft‚Äôs entire current AI strategy is built around the Azure‚ÄØAI‚ÄØFoundry platform**. It has become the centralized backbone for all AI-related innovation across Azure, GitHub, Microsoft 365, edge devices, and more. Here's a breakdown of how Foundry fits into that strategy:

---

## üöÄ What Azure AI Foundry Is Today

* A **unified AI ‚Äúagent factory‚Äù**: Designed to create, deploy, and manage AI apps and agents at scale‚Äîwhether cloud-based or at the edge‚Äîwith a flexible, modular SDK, agent frameworks (like Semantic Kernel & AutoGen), and pipelines for RAG (retrieval‚Äëaugmented generation) ([azure.microsoft.com][1], [azure.microsoft.com][2]).
* **General availability** for both web portal and SDK, with full support in Python, C#, and soon JavaScript .
* Includes an expansive **model catalog**‚Äîspanning Azure OpenAI, frontier models, and community open-source models‚Äîwith benchmarking, auto-scaling, and deployment flexibility‚Äîmanaged compute, pay-per-call, or private network isolates ([learn.microsoft.com][3]).

---

## üîß Core Capabilities Forming Microsoft‚Äôs AI Ecosystem

1. **Agent Services & Multi‚Äëagent workflows**

   * Agent Service is GA, letting you build production AI agents with templated actions and integrate them into Teams, Slack, Twilio, etc. Supports chained or orchestrated "agents-as-tools" workflows ([azure.microsoft.com][4]).

2. **Observability & Safety**

   * Built-in monitoring via Azure Monitor/Application Insights.
   * New safety-driven model leaderboards ranking over 1,900 models on safety, cost, reliability, and throughput ([learn.microsoft.com][5], [ft.com][6]).

3. **Edge & local AI (Foundry Local)**

   * At Build 2025, Microsoft unveiled support for running small LLMs on edge devices via Foundry Local ([devblogs.microsoft.com][7]).

4. **Openness & model diversity**

   * Foundry is hosting models from OpenAI, xAI‚Äôs Grok 3, Anthropic, Mistral, DeepSeek, NVIDIA, Hugging Face, and more‚Äîhighlighting interoperability and developer choice ([en.wikipedia.org][8], [theverge.com][9]).

5. **Strategic hosting of Grok 3**

   * At Build 2025 Satya Nadella announced Grok 3 & Grok 3 mini from xAI on Azure AI Foundry‚Äîmaking Microsoft the first major cloud to host these models ([theverge.com][9]).

6. **Enterprise-grade infrastructure**

   * Custom AI chips (Maia, Cobalt), investment in \$80‚ÄØbillion FY‚ÄØ2025 AI/data center capacity; backed by CoreAI led by ex‚ÄëFacebook exec Jay Parikh to scale sustainable AI operations ([en.wikipedia.org][10]).

# 6. Semantic Kernel vs AutoGen?

Semantic Kernel vs AutoGen. what is the strategy o Microsoft related to this two products? 
why the two? 
what is the correct choice for my company?

Here‚Äôs a clearer breakdown of Microsoft‚Äôs strategy regarding **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen**, helping you decide which fits your company best:

---

## üß© Core Differences

### **Semantic Kernel**

* **Purpose**: A production‚Äëready **SDK** for building AI-powered apps by integrating LLMs and data stores.
* **Strengths**:

  * **Stability & support**: v1.0+ across .NET, Python, Java ‚Äî no breaking changes, backed by Microsoft support ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).
  * Includes **Agent Framework** (single-agent) and **Process Framework** for stateful business workflows.
  * Ideal for enterprise scenarios requiring reliability, governance, observability and integrating with existing systems ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).

### **AutoGen**

* **Purpose**: An experimental, **multi-agent** framework from Microsoft Research.
* **Strengths**:

  * Enables **teams of agents** that collaborate, communicate, and self-organize via dialogue ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).
  * Event-driven, distributed, with patterns like Magentic-One showing state-of-art results ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).
  * Offers **AutoGen Studio**, a low-code UI to build/debug multi-agent workflows ([arxiv.org][2]).

---

## üîó Strategy: Convergence Ahead

* Microsoft is actively **aligning both frameworks** toward a **shared multi-agent runtime**, enabling smooth transitions from experimentation (AutoGen) to production (Semantic Kernel) ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).
* Key integrations planned:

  1. **Shared runtime architecture**
  2. **Hosting AutoGen agents within Semantic Kernel**
  3. **AutoGen using SK connectors/plugins** for tools and data access ([devblogs.microsoft.com][3]).

---

## ‚úÖ Which is Right for Your Company?

### Choose **Semantic Kernel** if:

* You‚Äôre building **production-grade enterprise applications.**
* You require **stability, long-term support, governance**, and enterprise integrations.
* You need its **Process Framework** to model stateful, human-in-the-loop workflows ([bravent.net][4], [devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).

### Choose **AutoGen** if:

* You‚Äôre in R\&D, exploring **multi-agent collaboration**, or building experimental agent interactions.
* You‚Äôre prototyping novel agentic patterns or cutting-edge use cases.
* You‚Äôre comfortable with evolving frameworks and community-led support ([devblogs.microsoft.com][1]).

### Community Insight:

> **‚ÄúAutoGen ‚Üí Best for research & multi-agent experimentation.
> Semantic Kernel ‚Üí Production‚Äëready, stable & Microsoft‚Äëbacked.‚Äù** ([reddit.com][5])

And from GitHub:

> **‚ÄúWe work closely ‚Ä¶ to integrate their most successful agentic research patterns into Semantic Kernel‚Ä¶ for proof of concepts, experimentation, and research.‚Äù** ([github.com][6])

---

## üî≠ Your Next Steps

1. **Start with Semantic Kernel** if your priority is enterprise reliability.
2. Use **AutoGen** for **prototyping**, complex agent workflows, or R\&D scenarios.
3. **Migrate your prototypes** to Semantic Kernel as the frameworks converge in early 2025.

---

### üìå TL;DR

* **Semantic Kernel** = enterprise stability, production readiness.
* **AutoGen** = experimental multi-agent innovation.
* Microsoft is uniting them ‚Äî start safe with SK, experiment with AutoGen, then consolidate using the unified runtime.
