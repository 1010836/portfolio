# 1. sensitive info in repo?

how can I manage sensitive information inside a GitHub repo like passwords credentials etc.
I now that we can use variables in env files that don't go to git and the when 
deploy we get this info using azure key vault and lots of other techniques outside of git.
what I want to now is how can I store tis confidential info inside my git repo?


Here are effective strategies to **store confidential information within a Git repo**—but *encrypted and secure*:

---

## 🔐 1. Transparent encryption: `git-crypt` or `transcrypt`

* Add `.gitattributes` to indicate which files (like `*.env`, `secrets.yml`) should be encrypted upon commit and decrypted upon checkout.
* Setup example for `git-crypt`:

  ```bash
  git-crypt init
  echo "*.env filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt" >> .gitattributes
  git-crypt export-key ../vault-key
  ```

  Collaborators then unlock with `git-crypt unlock ../vault-key` ([medium.com][1], [blog.gitguardian.com][2], [blog.lrvt.de][3]).
* Transparent and automatic—no extra commands after setup. Good for mixing encrypted files with plain code.&#x20;

**Pros:** automatic, easy to integrate.
**Cons:** metadata still visible, no file-level revocation, less granular, encryption limited to file content.&#x20;

## 🛡 2. File-level encryption: `git-secret` (GPG) or `SOPS` (multi-KMS)

* **git-secret**: GPG-encrypt individual files into `*.secret` versions. Plaintext ignored. Recipients decrypt using GPG ([medium.com][1]).
* **SOPS** (by Mozilla): Supports YAML, JSON, INI. Encrypts *values* but leaves structure readable. Works with AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, PGP, age ([medium.com][1]). Developers can inspect configuration diffs and commit history without exposing secrets.

**Pros:** fine-grained control, powerful integrations, transparent diffs.
**Cons:** needs KMS or GPG, initial setup more involved.

## 🗃 Extra best practices (OWASP & community advice)

* **Least privilege**: encrypt per environment/team, rotate keys regularly. ([stackoverflow.com][4])
* Segment sensitive files into separate, access-controlled repos. ([reddit.com][5])
* Consider external vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) for runtime only, with Git encrypted backups for fallback.&#x20;
* Prevent accidental leaks: use GitHub’s secret-scanning, push-protection, and detection tools.&#x20;

## ✅ Recommended usage patterns

| Tool           | When to use                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **git-crypt**  | Repo with a few secret files; encrypt automatically via `.gitattributes`.    |
| **git-secret** | GPG-based encryption per-file; manual decrypt/encrypt workflow.              |
| **SOPS**       | Config files (JSON/YAML), need structured diffs, use KMS/PGP/age integrated. |

---

### Example: using **SOPS** with Azure Key Vault

```yaml
# secrets.yaml
apiKey: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:...,iv:...,tag:...,type:str]
otherSecret: ENC[...]
```

* Values encrypted via Azure Key Vault (or other KMS)
* Safe to commit YAML; key material isn't exposed
* Developers with KMS permissions can decrypt via `sops` locally ([patrickvankleef.com][6], [medium.com][1], [seifrajhi.github.io][7])

---

### 🧩 Summary

Yes, you *can* store confidential info *in* your Git repo—**but only encrypted**. For most projects:

1. Use `git-crypt` for simple, automatic file encryption.
2. Prefer `SOPS` (or `git-secret`) for structured or multi-environment configs.
3. Combine with external KMS/vaults, access policies, and Git server protection tools.
4. Always use encryption and access control—it’s better than plain `.env` files.
