# 1. MCP and A2A?

can I use MCP servers and A2A in AI foundry?

Yes ‚Äî **Azure AI Foundry now supports both MCP and A2A protocols**, enabling advanced interoperability with external systems and agent ecosystems:

---

## üîÑ Model Context Protocol (MCP)

* Foundry Agent Service includes **turnkey MCP-server integration**, letting agents dynamically connect to MCP-capable clients via a unified protocol ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][1]).
* You can **build your own MCP server** using Python (e.g. via `mcp[cli]`, `azure‚Äëai‚Äëprojects`, etc.), connect Agent Service to clients like Claude, VS Code, Semantic Kernel, or OpenAI Agents SDK ([devblogs.microsoft.com][2]).
* The MCP server exposes tools, web grounding, private data retrieval, evaluation, and more in a standardized way ([devblogs.microsoft.com][3]).

---

## ü§ù Agent-to-Agent (A2A)

* **A2A support is now available (GA/Preview)** in Foundry Agent Service and Copilot Studio ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][4]).
* Enables seamless multi-turn communication between agents‚Äîe.g. passing context, invoking tasks‚Äîacross different platforms (Azure, AWS, Google, on-prem, open-source like AutoGen, LangChain, Semantic Kernel) ([microsoft.com][5]).
* Built-in governance with mutual TLS, Azure AD auth, audit logs, and enterprise-grade security ([microsoft.com][5]).

## ‚úÖ What This Means for You

1. **MCP**: Use Foundry‚Äôs Python-based MCP server or integrate with the open protocol to connect your agents to diverse data sources and LLM workflows seamlessly.
2. **A2A**: Orchestrate multi-agent ecosystems‚ÄîFoundry agents can talk to other agents and platforms via A2A API head, enabling task delegation, context-hand-over, and collaboration.
3. **Combined Use**: Build multi-agent, tool-integrated systems that share both tasks and context, with full enterprise security and observability.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Next Steps

1. Choose your integration pattern:

   * Use **Python-based MCP server** (via Foundry SDK).
   * Or connect via **Semantic Kernel** for MCP/A2A integration.
2. Explore **MCP Python samples** and **A2A orchestration support** in the Agent Service.
3. Extend Foundry's orchestration with **AutoGen, LangChain**, or **open-source orchestrators**.
4. Deploy and secure interactions using Azure identity, TLS, audit logging.
